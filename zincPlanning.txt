ZINC
When a repeated event is triggered, after the last notification for the event is sent out, set up the next set of notifications for the event
Even though I will have a database of users, also store the names of the contacts in EZtexting anyways
Instead of logging in to the website, to verify that the user is changing their account settings, send an auth code to the phone that expires. And that is their disposable password.
Add support to enable a user to change phone numbers and retain their old settings
For all this to work, there will need to be some sort of message retention/conversation history, that way I can figure out what the last message is and respond accordingly
